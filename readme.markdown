# andromeda
Andromeda is a clone of ogame, it will replicate ogame's buildings, ships, battle system etc.

Andromeda will be seperated into two seperate projects, the backend and frontend. The backend will be the server which manages the
resource collection, battles and the like. It will have a nice API to which the frontend will be able to connect to.
